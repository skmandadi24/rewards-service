A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every
dollar spent over $50 in each transaction
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
 


To run the code:
 - Checkout the project
 - Run the application as a Spring Boot application after a 'mvn clean build'
 - URL to get the reward points: [ http://<<URL>>:<<PORT>>/rewards/api/v1/customers ]
